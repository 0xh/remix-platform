# Remix

_A modern group chat app_

## Mission

We are working to create software focused on highlighting real discussions and
meaningful human interactions without the baggage of traditional social media.
Remix is for chatting with friends, loved ones, or interesting strangers - no
invasive advertisements, no spam-filled timelines, no FarmVille invites.

Create groups with friends, find public groups on interesting topics, or discuss
daily life privately with your closest friends
